## Tailscale is the bomb dot com

I tore apart the messy set of wires in the basement printer area and distributed the computers to other places. 

I'd installed Tailscale a while back, but hadn't really used it other than a convenience.

Now that the servers are running wireless, I don't know what ip address they're using... and I don't care.

Now I have to fix up the connections pushing data to Minio.  Minor pain, but if the ip addresses are reliable, then I don't have to worry about managing it. 

One question - won't tailscale run out of ip addresses to distribute?

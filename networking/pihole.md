# Love me PiHole

But - when I'm on the road, the mapping back to the PiHole machine screws up the DNS and I have to remember to adjust the addresses, or I stare blankly at the screen wondering why I can't connect. 

So maybe it's worth it to move some of this stuff to DigitalOcean?  

Yes - it's an expense, but then I don't have to worry about the machine going down and I can map out differently. 

It's a cloud solution. 

Oh, yeah, and maybe use it for backup?

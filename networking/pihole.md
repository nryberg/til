# Love me PiHole

But - when I'm on the road, the mapping back to the PiHole machine screws up the DNS and I have to remember to adjust the addresses, or I stare blankly at the screen wondering why I can't connect. 

So maybe it's worth it to move some of this stuff to DigitalOcean?  

Yes - it's an expense, but then I don't have to worry about the machine going down and I can map out differently. 

It's a cloud solution. 

Oh, yeah, and maybe use it for backup?

## Hate the PiHole

When it's not working as expected. Now the little server its running on is dead.  Dead!  So no DNS, so anything hard code to it for DNS? Done.

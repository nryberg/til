# Fun with Python Dates

Python gives you some flexible tools for managing dates.  My goal was to get URL ready epoch timestamps for yesterday and today.

```python
epoch = datetime.date(1970,1,1)
one_day = datetime.timedelta(days=1)

today = datetime.date.today()

yesterday = today - one_day

end = str((today - epoch).total_seconds()).split('.')[0]
begin = str((yesterday - epoch).total_seconds()).split('.')[0]
```
